## What is Front-End?
It is the practice of designing a website or a web application in a way that the user finds it interactive, friendly and appealing. What is it that we look for in a website when we are surfing the internet? The UI aka the user interface. If FACEBOOK did not look the way it does, if there were all default buttons and links all over your mobile screen will it be that fun an famous as it is now? Which brings us to the other challenge of Front-end development, i.e: not just building beautiful informative websites but making them "RESPONSIVE".

### What are responsive websites?
Well nowadays its not that you just surf the web through your desktop or laptop. Mostly we use mobile phones(of different screen sizes), tablets, ipad, etc. So how would it be if the columns were turned into rows when the screen size is reduced? I dont think that is what happens right. The screen, the web page anything that you are looking at adjusts itself with every device you open it with, keeping the functionality intact. This feature in a website is called the responsiveness, which is a must now.

## Where to start?

Just like while building a house you need to lay a foundation, this is no different. The road map to this is HTML->CSS->JAVASCRIPT(well atleast in my opinion).

#### 1. HTML: 
Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating webpages. It describes the structure of a webpage and consists of a series of elements. It tells the browser, how to display its contents by labelling them as 'header' , 'paragraphs', 'footer' etc.

#### 2. CSS:
Cascading Style Sheets describes how html elements are to be displayed on screen. It reduces a lot of work, as it can control the layout of multiple web pages at once. External style sheets are stored in css files.

#### 3. JAVASCRIPT:
Being the most popular programming language, it is the language of the web. It sets the logic behind all the html pages that you make.

## The Frameworks

Frameworks are packages that contains standard pre-written code. They are really helpful because they provide you a base, to improvise with the final design. The following are the components that you can expect from a framework:
1.Built-in web components like navigation bars, panels and various buttons and clickable links.
2.Pre-defined font sizes and styles.
3.Grid to ease on the website layout.

#### Dos and Don'ts?

While you can use them to save time to get started with the website, and having a pre-tested base that is compatible with most browsers , its important to know how you should NOT use them.
Code reusability is really something we are living for and using frameworks for that purpose is fine, but treating them as a replacement of your skills is NO good. Remember, these frameworks are your assistants not your wheel chair.

Some examples of frameworks are BOOTSTRAP, FOUNDATION, etc. However which framework to use to complement your work totally depends upon what your website needs.

## My Recommendation

Its been more than a year now , that I fell in love with front-end development. Although it was not always like this. I have built more than 10 websites that just contains a colored page  with a plain "hello world" text. I started from scratch and things changed when I started with React. It is not mandatory, but its amazing.

### npx create-react-app "my-first-webapp"

After you have laid your foundation, now that you know about html, css, and javascript you can get started with this. Its a javascript library that is used to build user interfaces. Maintained by Facebook and a community of developers, its used a base of single page and mobile applications. It concerns with state management and rendering it to the DOM(DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL). It requires additional libraries.

## Build your first app.

Reading blogs and knowing the road map is really helpful, but things dont get done until you do them. Build your first app, from scratch, improvise, design and be creative. You will be a front-end developer in no time. ALL THE BEST.
