# Building the Front-End.



By Jayasri Dey.


## What is Front-End?
It is the practice of designing a website or a web application in a way that the user finds it interactive, friendly and appealing. What is it that we look for in a website when we are surfing the internet? The UI aka the user interface. If FACEBOOK did not look the way it does, if there were all default buttons and links all over your mobile screen will it be that fun an famous as it is now? Which brings us to the other challenge of Front-end development, i.e: not just building beautiful informative websites but making them "RESPONSIVE".

### What are responsive websites?
Well nowadays its not that you just surf the web through your desktop or laptop. Mostly we use mobile phones(of different screen sizes), tablets, ipad, etc. So how would it be if the columns were turned into rows when the screen size is reduced? I dont think that is what happens right. The screen, the web page anything that you are looking at adjusts itself with every device you open it with, keeping the functionality intact. This feature in a website is called the responsiveness, which is a must now.

## Where to start?

Just like while building a house you need to lay a foundation, this is no different. The road map to this is HTML->CSS->JAVASCRIPT(well atleast in my opinion).

#### 1. HTML: 
Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating webpages. It describes the structure of a webpage and consists of a series of elements. It tells the browser, how to display its contents by labelling them as 'header' , 'paragraphs', 'footer' etc.
